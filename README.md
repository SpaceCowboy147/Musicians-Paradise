online music store including spring security.

Currently have a registration using a java servlet to connect to the html form, get the user input and store in a database. Still need to get the login to redirect to the main shop but I'm pretty sure I need to play with the HTML side to get it to redirect correctly. The default url after succesful login just is not working for me with the custom security. 

Things I'm working on:
- hashing and salting user input passwords for obvious reasons.
- Email validation
- reset password
- order/userCart implementation
-admin roles to add do some CRUD on the database. Need to keep products up to date, of course.
