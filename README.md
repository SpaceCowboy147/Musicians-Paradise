# Musicians-Paradise
https://musicians-paradise.herokuapp.com/registration

  Online music store using Spring boot. You can create a new user and BCrypt will encrypt the password then store the details onto JawsDB mysql server. I have user and admin roles where admin can add/delete new items while user has permissions to order items.
  
  For the default user the username and password is: 
  username: user password: 123
  For admin login:
  username: admin password: 123



Things I'm working on:

In stock quantity for database

fix CSS and html to the registration form.

delete quantity from cart

order history
